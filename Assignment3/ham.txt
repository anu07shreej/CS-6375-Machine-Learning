some

i

why
was

allocated

transport

through

31
97
and
then
started
to
be
allocated
to
the
089
contract
later
are
the
transport
contracts
no
longer
valid
to
allocate
to
and
is
that
the
reason
the
089
contract
was
used
or
should
the
transport
contract
be
allocated
to
instead
of
the
089
contract
for
11
97
forward
each
item
indicates
a

either
a

all
the

you
need
to
get
a
better
value
for
the
paltry
salary
'
s
you
are
paying
me
maybe
a
tues
thurs

work
better
for
each
of

or
if

are
going

they
seem
to
be
you
don
'
t
need
me
at

if

hplr
business
change
to
ect
in
1999
when
copano
began
allocating
line
gain
to
themselves
again
i
contacted
lauri
karen
and
yourself
to
see
if
i
could
get
the
contract
in
pops
karen
sent
me
an
e
mail
indicating
that
she
set
up
a
new
contract
for
this
hplc
line
gain
purchase
global
96022367
i
don
'
t
have
a
synergi
contract
number
i
know
that
in
3
99
lauri
contacted
bernard
widacki
at
copano
to
discuss
this
issue
i
need
lauri
to
review
this
and
then
i
need
the
contract
to
be
put
in
pops
so
that
i
can
correctly
allocate
the
gas
at
this
meter
i
have
not
allocated
any
line
gain
in
1999
and
the
volumes
are
small
karen
is
the
most
knowledgeable
about
this
contract
so
i
suggest
that
any
questions
be
directed
to
her
regarding
contract
issues
karen
worked
with
bernard
widacki
at
copano
to
set
up
the

originally

what

by

a
user
that
does
not

the

can
have
well
over

gets
locked

clear
out
all

we
will
be
making

resolve
this

however
your

where

is

'
s
costs
in
adding

eliminating
additional

it
is
appropriate
to
establish
the

on

this
provides
a
more
close
matching
of

accordingly

turning
to

'
s
exceptions
we
find
that
the
judge
correctly
rejected
the
seasonal
differential
even
if
we
accept
the
company
'
s
interpretation
of
purpa
it
still
has
not
cited
any
record
evidence
whatsoever
of
a
difference
in
costs
between
summer
and
nonsummer
months
without
at
least
some
showing
of
a

difference
it
is
impossible
to
make
a
judgment
on
the

of
the
company
'

proposal
we
therefore
uphold
the
judge
on
this
point
we
reverse

of
a

set
at

economy

rise

historically
many
purpa
type
standards
have
been
used
in
designing
wholesale
rates
for
the
sale
of
federal
hydroelectric

pmas
analyze
costs
to
establish
revenue
requirements
and
consider
this
information
in
designing
rates
declining
block
rates
for
energy
were
once
used
by
the
pmas
but
subsequently
were
found
inappropriate
and
eliminated
from
rate
schedules
many
of
the
pmas
for
years
have
been
effectively
using
various
forms
of
load
management
measures
in
their
rate
schedules
such
as
scheduling
limitations
loadshaping
capacity
and
energy
overrun
charges
etc

industrial

interruptible

some
time
ago
southwestern

had
interruptible

rates
in
effect
since
1957
these
examples
demonstrate
the
willingness
of
the
pmas
to
implement
purpa
type
standards
where
applicable
many
of
these
purpa
type
standards
when
applied
appropriately
in
the
design
of

can
serve
to
implement
the
purposes
of
purpa
by
encouraging
conservation
of
energy
efficient
use
of
resources

and

the
public

process
will
provide
an
opportunity
to

these
and

the

pricing
flexibility
may
take
several
different
forms
for
instance
a
contract
could
provide
qfs
with
a
price
floor
applicable
to
all
the
power
supplied
to
the
utility
but
still
provide
for
higher
variable
unit
prices
reflecting
daily
or
seasonal
periods
the
price
floor
would
provide
the
revenue
stream
necessary
for
the
qf
to
secure
financial
support
while
32
174
the
price
variability
would
induce
the
qf
to
maximize
deliveries
in
peak
load
periods
when
the
utility
values
additional
supplies
most
of
course
the
price
floor
should
not
exceed
the
minimum
value
of
the
utility
'
s
avoided
cost
similarly
a
contract
could
provide
for
a
two
part
price
a
fixed
payment
for
capacity
and
an
energy
price
for
power
delivered
the
qf
would
be
assured
a
minimum
revenue
stream
based
on
the
value
of
its
capacity
the
variable
energy
component
would
allow
the
utility
to
dispatch
the
qf
capacity
only
when
it
was
economic
whatever
the
pattern
of
contract
payments
rates
for
purchases
from
qfs
should
always
reflect
how
well
the
characteristics
of
the
suppliers
'
power
match
the
purchasing
utility
'
s
need
this
will
ensure
that
the
qf
will
make
most
production
decisions
on
the
basis
of
rates
reflecting
avoided
costs
rather
than
the
guaranteed
average
rate
and
at
the
same
time
will
receive
revenues
sufficient
to
attract
investors
to
avoid
problems
such
as
those
associated
with

the

costs
in

of

especially
in

fyi
this

went
in
for

group
it
gives
them
the
ability

counterparties
names

bridge
back
impact
to
logistics
unify
if
a
counterparty
name
change
takes
place
to
deals
that
have
been
bridge
backed
it
could
cause
problems
on
edi
pipes
as
that
new
counterparty
name
will
flow
over
to
unify
and
repathing
should
eventually
take
place
one
problem
may
be
with
the
imbalance
data
sets
which
are
not
in
production
yet
edi
imbalance
qtys
would
not
match
up
to
paths
this
may
also
cause
an
issue
with
the
scheduled
quantities
especially
where
nominations
were
sent
for
entire

can
'
t
remember
the
rules
on
this
one

i
think
unify
does

safe
guards
idiot
proofs
to
force
re
pathing
unify
does
have
the
ability
to
over
ride
duns
numbers
yet
would
still
cause
an
additional
step
for
edi
the
scheduler
would
need
to
think
through
in
order
to
get
a
clean
quick
response
what
are
if
any
impacts
to
vol
mgt
if
counterparty
name
changes
take
place
prior
periods
re

i
have
a
call
into
diane
and
dave
both
after
speaking
w
them
hopefully
i
can
get
a
clear
understanding
of
the
true
impact
i
am
sure
we
'
ll
need
to
put
some
processes
and
procedures
together
for

validation
to
follow
when
these
type
of

are

in

due

regarding
the
ability
to
change
counterparties
on
deals
in
sitara
with
confirmed
volumes
tom
'
s
words
of
caution
if
someone
calls
you
and
wants
to
change
a
counterparty
we
created
the
ability
for
you
to
invalidate
the
deal
and
then
change
the
counterparty
however
i
did
add
a
warning
message
warning
changing
counterparty
on
deal
with
confirmed
volumes
make
sure
pipeline
allows
this
change
some
pipelines
do
not
allow
us
to
change
counterparties
after
there
is
feedback
i
assume
for
the
same
reasons
we
had
this
rule
it
used
to
blow
up
our
old
scheduling
systems
pre
unify
some
pipelines
will
require
a
new
deal
and
we
will
have
to
zero
out
the
old
deal
before
you
make
the
change
make
sure
the
logistics
person
is
aware
just
in
case
it
causes
problems
with
their
pipeline
sorry
i
don
'
t
know
which
pipes
these
are
you
will
have
to
ask
the
unify
team
there
is
one
rule
still
in
place
you
can
change
from
ena
im
east
to
ena
im
market
east
but
not
from
ena
im
texas
to
hplc
im
hplc
when
changing
business
units
they
must
be
the
same
legal
entity
warning
not
the
same
legal
entity
also
beware
of
making
contract
and
counterparty
changes
to
service
deals
transport
capacity
storage
cash
out
once
the
deal
is
invalidated
there
are
no
rules
don
'
t
forget
the
items
were
locked
down
for
a
reason
if
you
invalidate
a
service
deal
and
change
the
previously
locked
down
data
that
was
validated
and
someone
used
these
deals
in
unify
it
is
highly
likely
that
the
unify
deals
and
paths
created
using
these
deals
will
get
corrupted
always
check
with
someone
from
unify
to
make
sure
no
one
used
these
deals
for
anything
in
unify

report
howard
apprised
me
in

that
the
reason
this

is
appearing

is
due
to
no
volumes
being
scheduled
in
pops
but
volumes
appearing
in
mops
the
volumes
this
meter
is
for
4449
sitara
deal
tickets
240095
and
227697
due
to
this
being
a
check
meter
the
volumes
will
not
bridge
to
pops
from
mops
i
'
d
like
to
request
to
revise
the
nome
of
4449
to
show
0
instead
can

how

sure

recoup

cost
also
could

fuel
cause
a

imbalance
i
think
that
pipeline
operations
can
handle
the
scheduling
of

fuel
retainage
but
if
we
retain
fuel
on

transports
then
we

i
am
uncomfortable
putting
a
deal
out
there
without
more
details
here
are
my
questions
1
why
was
this
gas
just
discovered
now
and
where
has
it
been
hiding
2
adonis
is
a
wmbe
which
means
he
has
a
direct
pay
agreement
so
never
pays
for
gas
taken
we
have
to
invoice
the
actual
burner
for
this
gas
hl
p
tu
cp
l
etc
can
we
identify
end
user
and
see
if
they
paid
for
this
gas
or
will
have
to
pay
3
adonis
has
skipped
town
and
is
no
longer
in
business
hl
p
told
me
he
got
paid
for
gas
that
never
was
delivered
rumor
how
can
we
invoice
him
now
4
60
000
mmbtu
seems
like
a
high
volume
of
gas
to
slip

two
years
answer
the
above
questions
and
i
will

will
be

if
we

the
type
of
settlement
on

i
think
we
should
use
actuals
due
to
possibility
that
the

could
over
pull
with
out
our

on
a
daily
basis
we
would
receive
the

actuals
on

may
have
to

to
offset
the
imbalance

the

vance
per
our
conversation
we
have
two
possible
options
to
resolve
this
deal
depending
on
whether
the
wellheads
are
producing
or
not
producing
if
that
is
the
case
the
purchase
from
calpine
and
any
contracts
hedged
to
it
will
need
to
be
backed
up
in
the
system
to
a
wellhead
level
once
that
is
done
i
will
need
to
research
in
the
system
how
those
wellheads
were
allocated
and
paid
and
reallocate
to
your
calpine
deal
this
will
probably
have
to
go
back
to
hplc
'
s
ownership
of
hplr
'
s
gathering
assets
non
producing
should
we
determine
that
the
common
point
and
any
wells
behind
it
have
been
shut
in
or
p
a
'
d
we
will
need
to
reallocate
this
deal
to
zero
and
unwind
any
hedges
against
it
or
move
the
hedges
to
another
deal
if
possible
since
the
deal
is
older
we
probably
sold
lower
priced
contracts
against
the
production
and
a
buy
back
today
would
possibly
result
in
a
financial
loss
in
either
case
the
deal
needs
to
be
cleaned
up
back
to
the
date
of

which

i

email
you
as
soon
as

we

feedback
from

please
take
note
of
dave
'
s
very
important
message
regarding
sitara
positions
we
absolutely
cannot
afford
to
go
through
this
again
and
need
to
do
everything
possible
to
help
limit
the
exposure
with
prices
where
they
are
and
winter
weather
upon
us
we
will
most
likely
have
a
very
challenging
bid
week
that
being
said
i
want
each
of
you
to
make
sure
we
adhere
to
the
daily
clean
process
you
should
pull
all
the
necessary
reports
each
day
and
keep
after
the
schedulers
to
make
sure
they
are
up
to
date
if
you
wish
donna
and
richard
can
make
these
available
each
day
and
distribute
to
the
group
we
don
'
t
have
much
time
so
this
needs
to
happen
immediately
donna
please
provide
me
with
a
daily
summary
of
all
the

for
the
remainder
of

let
me

sitara
positions
end
of
month
feedback
from
unify
bob
et
al
as
i
am
sure
you
recall
we
had
a
problem
with
sitara
positions
earlier
in
the
month
and
had
to
cease
trading
early
and
revert
to
cpr
for
positions
although
i
have
not
gotten
very
far
in
my
transition
off
of
unify
and
onto
sitara
and
tds
we
do
see
some
potential
for
this
happening
again
towards
the
end
of
this
month
and
the
beginning
of
next
month
the
problem
with
managing
positions
is
a
combination
of
sheer
deal
counts
along
with
updates
to
those
deals
a
large
portion
of
these
updates
come
to
sitara
via
the
unify
bridge
back
process
it
would
be
ideal
if
we
could
continue
to
have
the
unify
data
cleaned
scrubbed
week
to
week
and
try
to
avoid
having
the
bulk
of
the
month
being
updated
bridged
in
the
final
week
days
of
the
month
i
know
this
is
the
goal
of
logistics
but
i
just
want
to
help
reinforce
that
goal
due
to
the
performance
impact
it
can
have
on
the
gas
trading
systems
perhaps
a
few
extra
pair
of
eyes
on
the
pipeline
exception
summary
and
the
bridge
back
pipeline
summary
in
unify
this
month
would
help
another
area
that
causes
these
transaction
counts
to
increase
is
the
need
to
have
2
months
active
at
a
time
in
other
words
when
november
is
over
and
we
are
in
the
first
week
or
two
of
december
sitara
continues
to
maintain
positions
for
november
this
november
data
degrades
the
ability
to
update
december
positions
in
a
timely
manner
we
may
find
ourselves
having
to
remove
the
november
deals
from
the
sitara
positions
sooner
than
we
have
in
the
past
i
will
be
trying
to
work
with
the
sitara
team
in
the
coming
days
weeks
to
implement
some
combination
of
quick
fixes
as
well
as
look
into
the
long
term
changes
necessary
to
support

increased

this

will
take
the

the

lacy
'
s
eye
exam
hi
bubba
lacy
got
her
eye
exam
yesterday
he
said
that
she
is
very
near
sighted
but
the
diabetes
has
not
affected
her
eyes
at
all
that
was
a
relief
she
'
s
been
having
headaches
so
i
was
concerned
they
probably
have
been
from
her
blood
sugars
being
out
of
control
she
is
doing
so
much
better
now
i
have
stopped
waking
her
up
to
check
it
in
the
night
the
levels
are
so
much
better
she
'
s
acting
a
lot
more
like
her
old
self
now
a
lot
nicer
to
me
i
guess
her
sugars
out
of
control
all
the
stress
of
tiger
dolls
was
what
was
wrong
with
her
she
doesn
'
t
say
the
cruel
things
to
me
that
she
used
to
i
knew
something
had
to
be
wrong
with
her
i
thought
surely
i
had
not
raised
a
child
with
such
a
mean
spirit
anyway
things
are
a
lot
better
tell
cole
that
mimi
hopes
his
eye
appointment
goes
as
well
as
lacy
'
s
let
him
call
to
tell
me
about
it
i
hope
he
gets
his
teary
eye
fixed
lacy
'
s
eye
doctor
talked
more
about
her
teeth
almost
than
he
did
her
eyes
he
couldn
'
t
believe
her
teeth
are
so
perfect
without
braces
and
she
is
so
tanned
you
can
see
her
a
mile
away
with
those
white
teeth
shining
when
she
smiles
she
has
a
dentist
appointment
for
cleaning
at
the
first
part
of
next
week
we
'
ll
talk
later
about
when
we

as
you
may
recall
this

just

it

for
april
2001
below
is

looks
like
when

attempted
to

up
i
believe
it
wouldn
'
t
let
you
because
of
one
or
both
of
the
contracts
being
canceled
or
expired
i
have
inquired
as
to
what
can
be
done
and
have
learned
that
you
can
contact
global
counterparties
and
have
them
temporarily
set
the
contract
s
back
up
for
a
short
period
to
give
us
time
run
the
volumes
through
the
system
as
i
am
unfamiliar
with
this
process
and
the
global
counterparty
personnel
i
do
not
have
a

you
hopefully
this
is
something
you
may
have
had
to
do
in

since

i
can
enter
the

in
once
the

up
and

in
case

northern
natural
gas
yesterday
enron
settled
a
procedural
dispute
with
dynegy
over
northern
natural
gas
our
settlement
allows
dynegy
to
exercise
its
option
to
acquire
the
pipeline
dismisses
their
texas
lawsuit
and
extends
enron
'
s
right
to
repurchase
until
june
30
we
reached
this
settlement
as
part
of
our
efforts
to
bring
enron
out
of
bankruptcy
while
we
would
like
to
keep
northern
natural
we
still
have
some
9
000
miles
of
safe
profitable
interstate
pipelines
as
a
base
to
rebuild
our
core
businesses
the
settlement
provides
the
best
opportunity
to
resolve
the
pipeline
issue
quickly
and
pursue
our
10
billion
damage
claim
against
dynegy
it
also
allows
us
to
avoid
the
very
substantial
costs
and
distractions
from
protracted
litigation
in
state
courts
we
want
to
see
a
positive
future
for
the
employees
working
with
northern
natural
gas
below
is
a
copy
of
a
message
from
stan
horton
further
explaining
this
decision
to
the
employees
of
enron
transportation
services
ken
dear
ets
colleague
on
thursday
enron
entered
into
a
settlement
over
dynegy
'
s
exercise
of
its
option
to
acquire
the
northern
natural
gas
pipeline
the
settlement
allows
dynegy
to
exercise
the
option
and
assume
interim
control
of
the
pipeline
while
enron
pursues
its
damage
claim
against
dynegy
in
this
respect
enron
corp
has
carefully
weighed
the
substantial
costs
and
turmoil
that
litigating
this
possession
issue
would
create
for
the
company
and
the
employees
of
northern
natural
gas
consequently
enron
corp
has
decided
not
to
contest
interim
possession
and
allow
the
transfer
of
northern
natural
gas
to
dynegy
while
the
larger
issues
affecting
its
future
are
resolved
the
company
has
concluded
that
with
this
settlement
enron
should
be
able
to
resolve
the
issue
more
quickly
as
well
as
avoid
the
legal
cost
burden
and
distractions
to
the
business
from
protracted
litigation
in
state
court
for
the
northern
natural
gas
employees
i
believe
this
decision
should
allow
them
to
steer
clear
of
the
dispute
and
focus
on
the
day
to
day
satisfaction
of
running
a
valuable
successful
business
beginning
immediately
we
will
be
working
to
achieve
a
smooth
transition
and
to
align
the
appropriate
resources
to
assure
continued
safe
reliable
and
efficient
operation
of
northern
natural
gas
over
many
years
we
have
run
high
quality
cost
conscious
and
profitable

recall
the
equity
owners

so
the
arrangement
would
probably
be
short

at
best
i
think
the
bank
that
has
collateral
rights
to
the

will
be
concerned

we
need
to
talk
about
the
ability
of
ena
to
continue
its
the
current
role
as
agent
of
tenaska
iv
1
since
the
end
on
november
ena
has
not
been
able
to
complete
gas
trading
transactions
we
cannot
find
any
counterparties
to
trade
physical
gas
in
texas
this
of
course
is
due
to
the
bankruptcy
as
a
result
we
are
not
able
to
sale
tenaska
'
s
excess
fuel
we
did
contact
brazos
to
ask
if
they
would
buy
a
portion
of
the
gas
at
a
gas
daily
price
but
they
do
not
want
it
gas
daily
pricing
has
been
below
the
firm
contract
price
for
a
while
in
december
we
had
to
cut
10

day
from
the
7
th
through
the
27
th
for
january
we
haven
'
t
had
to
cut
yet
but
i
am
sure
that
the
pipe
will
ask
us
to
do
this
in
the
near
future

for

activity
which
was
settled
in
dec
ena
owes
tenaska
iv
for
the
excess
supply
that
we
sold
however
due
to
the
bankruptcy
we
could
not
make
payments
out
ena
could
not
pay
the
suppliers
or
the
pipeline
james
armstrong
paid
the
counterparties
directly
i
think
that
he
should
continue
to
do
this
for
dec
and
jan
we
should
not
transfer
any
funds
from
tenaska
iv
to
ena
i
don
'
t
know
how
enron
'

ownership
in
the

factors
out
